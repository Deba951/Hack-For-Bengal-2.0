### The problem it solves: 
The problem at hand revolves around the challenges faced by individuals due to the scarcity of blood donors and limited availability of blood. These problems can be attributed to various factors, including:

1. Lack of proper knowledge about blood banks: Many people may not be aware of the existence or functioning of blood banks, which leads to a lack of understanding about where to go to donate blood or seek blood in times of need.

2. Limited access to blood banks: In certain areas, there may be a lack of accessible blood banks, making it difficult for individuals to donate blood or obtain it when required.

3. Limited supply of blood in blood banks: The supply of blood often falls short of the demand, creating a significant gap between the required units and the available units. It has been observed that our nation necessitates approximately 5 Crore units of blood annually, whereas only 2.5 Crore units are available.

To address these challenges, our proposed solution is the Blood Way application. This platform aims to enhance the management of blood supply in blood banks and assist individuals in need. The application offers the following features:

1. Managing blood incoming and outgoing log: The application maintains a comprehensive record of blood donations and distributions, ensuring transparency and effective management of the blood supply chain.

2. Providing location and details of blood banks: Users can access information about nearby blood banks through the application, including their addresses and contact details, making it easier to locate a suitable blood bank.

3. Providing the nearst blood banks of the required specimen in a sorted order.

By leveraging these features, the Blood Way application aims to bridge the gap between blood donors and recipients, facilitating a more efficient and accessible blood supply system.




### Challenges we ran into

During the process of building the Blood Way application to address the challenges related to blood donation and availability, we encountered several challenges. Some of these challenges included:

1. Data accuracy and reliability.
2. Integration with blood banks.
3. Privacy and security: Safeguarding the personal information of blood donors and recipients was a paramount concern. 
4. User adoption and awareness
5. User experience and interface design: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface in figma required a lot of deep thinking and implementing the same in flutter was another dfficult job.
6.  Ensuring the accuracy and reliability and their exact locations, and the availability of blood (updation).
7. Building the API in Flask and deploying the same was a tiedy job to do.
8. Finally we got stuck for a while in integrating the Firebase with our APK. 





### Built With

- **Figma** <br> 
- **Flutter** <br>
- **Dart** <br>
- **Firebase** <br>
- **Git Bash** <br>
- **Python** <br>
- **JSON** <br>
- **Pandas** <br>
- **Flask** <br>
- **Google Collab** <br>



## Further Plans
1. We can also develop new ways to encourage people to donate, such as gamification, usage of WEB3 environment and social media campaigns.
2. One exciting opportunity is the use of artificial intelligence to predict blood shortages and ensure that blood banks have enough supply to meet demand. This could revolutionize the way we approach blood donation and save countless lives.
3. We ae planning to add Payment Gateways into our platform to increase the valuation of our app.
4. We ar planning to add some Giveaways for the doners which will increase the interest of more and more pople to donate blood.
5. We also are planing to collaborate with sme or all major Hospitals and Nursing Homes for better reach.
